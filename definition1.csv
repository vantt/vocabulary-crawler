In English, though, we have to go back a millennium before we see the verb that we can easily connect to friend. Frēond, the Old English source of Modern English friend, is related to the Old English verb frēon, ""to love, like, honor, set free (from slavery or confinement)."" Specifically, frēond comes from the present participle of the Germanic ancestor of Old English frēon and thus originally meant ""one who loves."" (The Old English verb frēon, ""to love, set free,"" by the way, survives today in Modern English as to free.) The Germanic root of frēond and frēon is *frī-, which meant ""to like, love, be friendly to."" Closely linked to these concepts is that of ""peace,"" and in fact Germanic made a noun from this root, *frithu-, meaning exactly that. Ultimately descended from this noun are the personal names Frederick, ""peaceful ruler,"" and Siegfried, ""victory peace."" The root also shows up in the name of the Germanic deity Frigg, the goddess of love, who lives on today in the word Friday, ""day of Frigg,"" from an ancient translation of Latin Veneris diēs, ""day of Venus."""

Nonetheless, people have been raising children in English since the 1700s, and the usage has been standard for many generations, at least in American English. The Usage Panelists find the use of raise acceptable both for children and for livestock. The Panelists also approve of using the verb rear for children, but a sizable minority have reservations about using it for livestock. In our 2013 survey, 41 percent disapproved of the sentence The settlers reared cattle in the Valley before it was flooded. This percentage, though still substantial, is a significant decrease from the 60 percent who disapproved of the same sentence in 2002. Although contemporary usage allows writers to raise both children and livestock, careful writers should rear children only."

Sentences like I hate these kind of movies may occur with some frequency but are awkward, and some would say, grammatically incorrect. The Usage Panel frowns upon these usages. In our 2005 survey, 81 percent rejected the use of kind with a plural modifier and plural noun in the sentence Those kind of buildings seem old-fashioned. Fully 88 percent of the Panel found unacceptable the use of kind with a singular modifier and plural noun and verb in That kind of buildings seem old fashioned. In these examples kind would presumably function as a determiner like number in A great number of people have crowded into the lobby. (Note that number here is singular, but the plural verb have agrees with the plural noun people, so number is not really the subject of the sentence). This problem can be avoided by making the phrase entirely singular (as in That kind of movie is always enjoyable) or by revising so that the noun is the plural subject (as in Movies of that kind are always enjoyable). Bear in mind that plural kinds often implies that the phrase refers to a number of different categories of things—more than one genre of movie, for example. Perhaps the best solution is to drop the kind phrase entirely (Those movies are always enjoyable) or to be specific (Those spy movies are always enjoyable)."
