Old is the most general term: old lace; an old saying.Ancient pertains to the distant past: ""the hills, / Rock-ribbed, and ancient as the sun"" (William Cullen Bryant).Archaic implies a very remote, often primitive period: an archaic Greek bronze of the seventh century bc.Antediluvian applies to what is extremely outdated: ""I ... went out to reconnoiter a fresh typewriter ribbon for Professor Mitwisser's antediluvian machine"" (Cynthia Ozick).Antique is applied to what is especially appreciated or valued because of its age: antique furniture; an antique vase.Antiquated describes what is out of date, no longer fashionable, or discredited: ""No idea is so antiquated that it was not once modern. No idea is so modern that it will not someday be antiquated"" (Ellen Glasgow).Usage Note:  Old, when applied to people, is a blunt term that usually suggests at least a degree of physical infirmity and age-related restrictions. It should be used advisedly, especially in referring to people advanced in years but leading active lives. Ã‚Â· As a comparative form, older might logically seem to indicate greater age than old, but in most cases the opposite is true. A phrase such as the older woman in the wool jacket suggests a somewhat younger person than if old is substituted. Where old expresses an absolute, an arrival at old age, older takes a more relative view of aging as a continuumâ€”older, but not yet old. As such, older is not just a euphemism for the blunter old but rather a more precise term for someone between middle and advanced age. And unlike elderly, older does not particularly suggest frailness or infirmity, making it the natural choice in many situations. See Usage Note at  elder1."

The ultimate origins of the word lie in the Dravidian language family, a family of languages spoken in South Asia that includes Kannada, Malayalam, Tamil, and Telugu. The modern Tamil word for an orange, for example, is nÄ?ram, and in ancient times, a Dravidian word similar to this was adopted into the Indo-European language Sanskrit as nÄ?raá¹…gaá¸¥. As the fruit passed westward from India, so did the word for it, becoming Persian nÄ?rang and Arabic nÄ?ranj. The Arabs brought the first oranges to Spain and Sicily between the 8th and 10th centuries, and from there the popularity of the fruit spread throughout Europe. The Arabic word is the source of Old Italian arancio, ""orange tree,"" and this word was compounded with Old Italian mela, ""apple,"" to make melarancio, referring to the fruit of the orange tree. Old Italian melarancio was translated into Old French as pume d'orenge, ""apple of the orange tree."" The a in the Old Italian word was replaced by o in Old French due to the influence of the name of the town of Orange (from which oranges reached the northern part of France) and possibly also due to the influence of the Old French word or, ""gold"" (by association with the rich color of the fruit). In the final stage in the journey of the word, the Old French form was borrowed into Middle English, at first spelled orenge in a text dating from around 1400. The English word orange begins to be used to designate the color orange in the 16th century."

When Alexander Pope wrote these lines from The Rape of the Lock in 1714, tea still rhymed with obey. This was true of many words spelled with ea, and it was just about in Pope's time that nearly all these words started changing their pronunciation from (Ä?) to (Ä“), as in our modern pronunciation of tea (tÄ“). Most modern English words whose main vowel sound is spelled -ea- were pronounced with long vowels in Middle and Old English. Many of these vowels were shortened in the 1500s and 1600s to their modern pronunciations, as in our words dead and sweat. But those words that were pronounced with an (Ä?) sound in Middle English did not undergo this sound change and kept their long vowels, undergoing the further change in Pope's time to the modern ""long e"" sound. There were several exceptions to this last sound change, most notably the words break, great, and steak. Interestingly, the old pronunciation is also retained in Irish family names, such as Reagan, Shea, Beatty, and Yeats (in contrast to British family names such as Keats)."

It is true that between is the only choice when exactly two entities are specified: the choice between (not among) good and evil, the rivalry between (not among) Great Britain and France. When more than two entities are involved, however, or when the number of entities is unspecified, the choice of one or the other word depends on the intended sense. Between is used when the entities are considered as distinct individuals; among, when they are considered as a mass or collectivity. Thus in the sentence The balloon landed between the houses, the houses are seen as points that define the boundaries of the area where the balloon touched down (so that we presume that the balloon did not land on any of the individual houses). In The balloon landed among the houses, the area of landing is considered to be the general location of the houses, taken together (in which case it is left open whether the balloon landed on one of the houses). By the same token, we may speak of a series of wars between the Greek cities, which suggests that each city was an independent participant in the hostilities, or of a series of wars among the Greek cities, which allows for the possibility that the participants were shifting alliances of cities. For this reason, among is used to indicate inclusion in a group: She is among the best of our young sculptors. There is a spy among you. Use between when the entities are seen as determining the limits or endpoints of a range: They searched the area between the river, the farmhouse, and the woods. The truck driver had obviously been drinking between stops."

The Germanic root of both words is *bÅ?k-, ultimately from an Indo-European root meaning ""beech tree."" The Old English form of book is bÅ?c, from Germanic *bÅ?k-Å?, ""written document, book."" The Old English form of beech is bÄ“ce, from Germanic *bÅ?k-jÅ?n, ""beech tree,"" because the early Germanic peoples used strips of beech wood to write on. A similar semantic development occurred in Latin. The Latin word for book is liber, whence library. Liber, however, originally meant ""bark""â€”that is, the smooth inner bark of a tree, which the early Romans likewise used to write on.bookÃ‚Â 2 Ã‚Â (boÍ?ok)intr.v.  booked, bookÃ‚Â·ing, books  Informal  To move or travel rapidly: We booked along at a nice clip.[Perhaps shortening and alteration  (influenced by book) of boogie.]"

But in fact the language name is found long before the country name. The latter first appears as Englaland around the year 1000 and means ""the land of the Engle,"" that is, the Angles. The Angles, Saxons, and Jutes were the three Germanic tribes that emigrated from what is now Denmark and northern Germany and settled in England around the fourth century ad. Early on, the Angles enjoyed a rise to power that must have made them seem more important than the other two tribes, for all three tribes are indiscriminately referred to in early documents as Angles. The speech of the three tribes was conflated in the same way: they all spoke what would have been called *Anglisc, or ""Anglish,"" as it were. By the earliest recorded Old English, this had changed to Englisc. In Middle English, the first vowel, originally pronounced (Ä•) in Old English, changed further and became the familiar (Ä­) of today, as reflected in the occasional spellings Ingland and Inglish. The same change in the pronunciation of the short vowel (Ä•) to (Ä­) before the sound (ng) also occurred in other Middle English words, such as streng and weng. In Modern English, these words are now always spelled string and wing with an i, but the old spelling with e, reflecting the vowel's earlier pronunciation, has been kept in the case of England and English.

Compare, for example, leggere in Italian, lire in French, and lesen in German. (Equally surprising is the fact that English is the only western European language not to derive its verb for ""to write"" from Latin scrÄ«bere.) Read comes from the Old English verb rÇ£dan, ""to advise, interpret (something difficult), interpret (something written), read."" RÇ£dan is related to the German verb raten, ""to advise"" (as in Rathaus, ""town hall""). The Old English noun rÇ£d, ""counsel,"" survives in the rare noun rede, ""counsel, advice"" and in the name of the unfortunate King Ethelred the Unready, whose epithet is often misunderstood. Unready here does not have its current sense ""unprepared""; it is a late 16th-century spelling of an earlier unredy, ""ill-advised, rash, foolish,"" from rede."

N., sense 3, from the fact that conservatives sit on the right side of the legislative chamber in various assemblies .]rightâ€²er n.rightâ€²ness n.Synonyms:  right, privilege, prerogative, perquisite These nouns apply to something, such as a power or possession, to which one has an established claim. Right refers to a legally, morally, or traditionally just claim: ""An unconditional right to say what one pleases about public affairs is what I consider to be the minimum guarantee of the First Amendment"" (Hugo L. Black).Privilege usually suggests an advantage or opportunity not enjoyed by everyone: Use of the company jet was a privilege reserved for the top executives. Prerogative denotes an exclusive right or privilege, as one based on custom, law, or office: It is my prerogative to change my mind. A perquisite is a privilege accorded by virtue of one's employment, position, or rank: ""The old newspapers and wax candle-ends from the drawing-room were the perquisites of the butler"" (Elizabeth Langland).Our Living Language  Speakers of Standard English mainly restrict the use of adverbial right to modify adverbs of space or time, as in She's right over there or Do it right now! No such restriction applies in Southern vernacular speech, where right can be used to intensify the meaning of many adjectives and adverbs, as in He's right nice or You talk right fast. This broader use of right is attested as far back as the 1400s and is found in the works of Shakespeare and other great writers. Thus, what appears to be neglect of Standard English rules is actually the retention of a historical usage. Ã‚Â· The use of right as an adverb indicating directness, completeness, or general intensity seems to be related to the use of right in a more concrete sense to refer to something that is perfectly straight or perpendicular to something else, as in right angle. A similar connection between concrete and metaphorical meaning lies behind the Southern adverbial usage of plumb, as in He fell plumb asleep as an indicator of completeness or totality."

The Old English form of beech is bÄ“ce, from Germanic *bÅ?k-jÅ?n, ""beech tree,"" because the early Germanic peoples used strips of beech wood to write on. A similar semantic development occurred in Latin. The Latin word for book is liber, whence library. Liber, however, originally meant ""bark""â€”that is, the smooth inner bark of a tree, which the early Romans likewise used to write on.bookÃ‚Â 2 Ã‚Â (boÍ?ok)intr.v.  booked, bookÃ‚Â·ing, books  Informal  To move or travel rapidly: We booked along at a nice clip.[Perhaps shortening and alteration  (influenced by book) of boogie.]"

Compare, for example, leggere in Italian, lire in French, and lesen in German. (Equally surprising is the fact that English is the only western European language not to derive its verb for ""to write"" from Latin scrÄ«bere.) Read comes from the Old English verb rÇ£dan, ""to advise, interpret (something difficult), interpret (something written), read."" RÇ£dan is related to the German verb raten, ""to advise"" (as in Rathaus, ""town hall""). The Old English noun rÇ£d, ""counsel,"" survives in the rare noun rede, ""counsel, advice"" and in the name of the unfortunate King Ethelred the Unready, whose epithet is often misunderstood. Unready here does not have its current sense ""unprepared""; it is a late 16th-century spelling of an earlier unredy, ""ill-advised, rash, foolish,"" from rede."
