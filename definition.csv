Old High German beran, Old Norse bera, Gothic bairan to carry, Skt bhÃ¡rati (one) carries, Latin ferre, Greek phÃ©rein to carry]  syn:  bear, stand, endure refer to supporting the burden of something distressing, irksome, or painful. bear is the general word and suggests merely being able to put up with something: She is bearing the disappointment quite well.  stand is an informal equivalent, but with an implication of stout spirit: I couldn't stand the pain. endure implies continued resistance and patience over a long period of time: to endure torture.  usage: Since the latter part of the 18th century, a distinction has been made between born and borne as past participles of the verb bear. borne is the past participle in all senses that do not refer to physical birth: The wheat fields have borne abundantly. Judges have always borne a burden of responsibility. borne is also the participle when the sense is “to bring forth (young)” and the focus is on the mother rather than on the child. In such cases, borne is preceded by a form of have or followed by by: She had borne a son the previous year. Two children borne by her earlier were already grown. When the focus is on the offspring or on something brought forth as if by birth, born is the standard spelling, and it occurs in passive constructions and in adjective phrases: My friend was born in Ohio. No children have been born at the South Pole. Abraham Lincoln, born in Kentucky, grew up in Illinois. bear2  (bɛər)  n.,  pl.  bears, (esp. collectively) bear, n.    1.  any large, stocky, omnivorous mammal of the carnivore family Ursidae, with thick, coarse fur, a very short tail, and a plantigrade gait, inhabiting the Northern Hemisphere and N South America.    2.  a gruff, clumsy, or rude person.    3.  a person who believes that stock prices will decline (opposed to bull).    4.

The deer family includes the white-tailed deer, elk, moose, and caribou.[Middle English der, beast, from Old English dēor.]Word History:  In Middle English texts one finds a fish, an ant, or a fox called a der, the Middle English ancestor of our word deer. In its Old English form dēor, the word referred to any animal, including members of the deer family, and continued to do so in Middle English, although it also acquired the specific sense ""a deer."" By the end of the Middle English period, around 1500, the general sense had all but disappeared. In Shakespeare's works, for example, the word deer usually refers to the antlered animals that we call deer today. However, a memory of the earlier, broader meaning is preserved in the words of the character Edgar in King Lear, which Shakespeare wrote sometime between 1603 and 1606. After being unjustly declared an outlaw by his father, Edgar disguises himself as a lunatic and lives in misery in the countryside under the name ""Poor Tom."" When he later meets his father, who has been blinded and cannot recognize his son, ""Tom"" explains that he survives by eating toads and tadpoles and whatever else he can catch: ""But mice and rats, and such small deer / Have been Tom's food for seven long year."" Here, such small deer would seem to mean ""other such small animals."" Another trace of the earlier meaning of deer is probably found in wilderness. This word is thought to descend from an unattested Old English word *wilddēornes, made up of Old English wilddēor or wildedēor, ""wild animal"" and the noun suffix -nes, the equivalent of the Modern English suffix -ness. Wilderness is thus ""wild-animal-ness,"" so to speak. The German word Tier, the cognate of Old English dēor and Modern English deer, still has the general sense of ""animal."""

The greatest variety of terms is to be found in the South, where the most widespread term is snake doctor (a name based on a folk belief that dragonflies take care of snakes). The Midland equivalent is snake feeder. Speakers from the Lower South and the Mississippi Valley, on the other hand, are more likely to refer to the same insect as a mosquito fly, mosquito hawk, or, in the South Atlantic states, a skeeter hawk. The imagery outside the South often alludes to the insect's shape rather than its behavior or diet: speakers in the West, in the Upper North, and in New England call it a darner, darning needle, or, less commonly, a devil's darning needle, and those in the Upper North also refer to it just as a needle; those in coastal New Jersey, a spindle."

This is in fact untrue. The word was first recorded in 1770 by Captain James Cook, when he landed to make repairs along the northeast coast of Australia. In 1820, one Captain Phillip K. King recorded a different word for the animal, written ""mee-nuah."" As a result, it was assumed that Captain Cook had been mistaken, and the myth grew up that what he had heard was a word meaning ""I don't know"" (presumably as the answer to a question in English that had not been understood). Recent linguistic fieldwork, however, has confirmed the existence of a word gangurru in the northeast Aboriginal language of Guugu Yimidhirr, referring to a species of kangaroo. What Captain King heard may have been their word minha, meaning ""edible animal."""

Lion See  Leo.Idiom:  lion's share The greatest or best part.[Middle English, from Old French, from Latin leō, leōn-, from Greek leōn, of Semitic origin; see lbÊ in Semitic roots.]Word History:  Old French lion is the source of English lion, and the Old French word comes from Latin leō, leōnis. The Latin word is related somehow to Greek leōn, leontos (earlier *lewōn, *lewontos), which appears in the name of the Spartan king Leonidas, ""Lion's son,"" who perished at Thermopylae. The Greek word is somehow related to Coptic labai, laboi, ""lioness."" In turn, Coptic labai is borrowed from a Semitic source related to Hebrew lābī' and Akkadian labbu. There is also a native ancient Egyptian word, rw (where r can stand for either r or l and vowels were not indicated), which is surely related as well. Since lions were native to Africa, Asia, and Europe in ancient times (Aristotle tells us there were lions in Macedon in his day), we have no way of ascertaining who borrowed which word from whom."
